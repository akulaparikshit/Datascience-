# ### Data Science Tools
# | Tool             | Description                              |
# |------------------|------------------------------------------|
# | Jupyter Notebook | Interactive development environment      |
# | VS Code          | Code editor with data science extensions |
# | Git              | Version control for projects             |
# | Tableau          | Data visualization tool                  | 

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# a = 20
# b = 10
# 
# add = a + b
# subtraction = a - b
# multiplication = a * b
# division= a / b
# 
# add = 30
# subtraction = 10
# multiplication = 200
# division= 2
# 

# In[3]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
exp = (3*4)+5
print(exp)


# In[4]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
print(200 / 6)
